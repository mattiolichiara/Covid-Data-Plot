# Covid-Data-Plot

Plotting data from a .csv to make it faster and easier to read.

# DETAILS

The library used to read and manage .csv data is pandas. <br>
Once the .csv has been read by the python script it gets filtered. <br>
Only a few of the columns are actually processed in this script
The actual .csv isn't modified, the script generates only a copy of the needed columns in form of a simple list.
